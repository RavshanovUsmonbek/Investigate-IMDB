    "> **Tip**: In this section of the report, provide a brief introduction to the dataset you've selected for analysis. At the end of this section, describe the questions that you plan on exploring over the course of the report. Try to build your report around the analysis of at least one dependent variable and three independent variables. If you're not sure what questions to ask, then make sure you familiarize yourself with the dataset, its variables and the dataset context for ideas of what to explore.\n",

To achieve unique identification we can use imdb_id and original_title as composite primary key in database. We can make sure that the combination of imdb_id and origanal_title provides unique values by looking the cell number 33. There we can see we have 0 number if duplicated rows when imdb_id is missing values and 0 number of rows with missing values when original_title cells have duplicated values.\n",
